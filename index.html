        <h1>Quote of the day</h1>
        <p>I have found that a big difference between new coders and experienced coders is faith: <br> faith that things are going wrong for a logical and discoverable reason,<br> faith that problems are fixable, faith that there is a way to accomplish the goal.<br> The path from not working to working might not be obvious, but with patience you can usually find it.</p>
